## Diagnosis: not a code bug — a stale companion process

I traced the whole pipeline and the current build is correct:

- The **live** `.companion/state.json` carries a proper `activity` field, and a
  reproduction feeding real state data through the app parses + phrases it as
  e.g. "Updating status" — **not** "Thinking…".
- **Timing**: c0109's transport (writing `activity` to `state.json`) landed
  22:56 on 07-20. The companion that worked c0110 (~23:16) was an **earlier
  process** — the current `gello-companion` PID only started 00:09 on 07-21.
  That old process still printed tool lines to the *terminal* (the pre-c0109
  c0104 path) but never wrote the new `activity` field, so the card fell back
  to "Thinking…" the whole run.

In short: the companion was running code from before the feature existed. A
restart fixes it (and the current one already emits activity). I've added an
end-to-end **regression test** across the companion→state.json→app seam (each
layer was unit-tested, but not the contract between them).

**How do you want to dispose this?**

- [x] Close it — accept it was a stale process; the seam test is enough. (Tip:
      restart the companion after updating its code.)
- [ ] Build robustness — have the app distinguish "companion running but
      reporting no activity / stale" from genuine "Thinking…" (e.g. a companion
      version/heartbeat in `state.json`). I'd scope this as its own change.
- [ ] Something else — say what you'd like.

It only shows thinking although the agent did:

## Investigation (agent, 2026-07-21)

Root cause: a **stale companion process** running code that predated c0109, not
a code defect. Evidence:

- The **live** `.companion/state.json` now carries a correct `activity` field
  for the running card, so the companion transport works.
- The app pipeline is wired end-to-end (App → Board → Column → CardFront →
  `cardActivity`), and a reproduction feeding the real `state.json` shape
  through `parseCompanionState` + `cardActivity` yields "Updating status", not
  "Thinking…". So there is no app-side defect either.
- Timing: c0109's transport (`activity` in `state.json`) landed at
  22:56 on 2026-07-20. The companion that worked c0110 (~23:16) was an earlier
  process (the current `gello-companion` PID started 00:09 on 2026-07-21).
  That old process still emitted tool lines to the **terminal** (the c0104
  `renderEvent` path, which predates c0109), but never wrote the new `activity`
  field — so the card fell back to "Thinking…" the whole run.

So: the current build already behaves correctly; the fix for the observed run is
operational (restart the companion after updating). There is no reproducing test
for a code bug, because the code is not the bug.

What I can still add regardless: an **end-to-end regression test** across the
companion→state.json→app seam (each layer is unit-tested today, but not the
boundary), so this multi-stage feature can't silently regress later. Awaiting a
call on disposition — see the question.

## Log

- 2026-07-21 status → ready (app)
- 2026-07-21 status → in-progress (agent)
- 2026-07-21 (agent) diagnosed: stale pre-c0109 companion, not a code bug; the
  live state.json + a real-data repro confirm the current build works. Asked
  the human how to dispose the card.
